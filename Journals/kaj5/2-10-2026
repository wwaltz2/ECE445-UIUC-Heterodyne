We had our first meeting with our TA for the project today to check on our team's organization and progress. It seems we are disatisfactory in our progress so far, as it appears
that most of the project should have been figured out by now including exactly what parts we should have and how many of them should be used and how they precisely all come
together as well as who is doing what. I added some subsystem requirements to the project proposal. It is supposed to be based on the block design but since its not ready 
yet I based it on the RFA's subsytems. I'll refine it further once the block diagram is ready. We also need to figure out the tolerance analysis part of the proposal, I believe our 
frequency tuner would be appropriate for that. Major progress is going to need to be made soon, we will need to have our parts ordered and a PCB design ready as well as starting
initial construction.
