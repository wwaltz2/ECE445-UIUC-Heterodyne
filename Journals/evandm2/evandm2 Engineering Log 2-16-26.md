## ECE445 Engineering Log #8

Just started on the schematic for the PCB today, hoping to get some more progress done tomorrow once we're all together in the lab.
Hopefully Gayatri thinks we've made enough progress. I really need to get us going on the heterodyne module. Once that part is finished, the actual PCB bringup should be rather quick.
Took care of the power module and MCU module today. LED is dual-purpose; indicates that current is flowing for preliminary debugging and to illuminate the dial.
Might opt to do a THT LED, depends on how bright it is (as we want it to actually illuminate the frequency dial).
MCU module includes the ISP and flash, and each power connection has reverse polarity protection just in case.

Next log will probably have much more detail on the choices we made for our mixer design, sources, etc.
