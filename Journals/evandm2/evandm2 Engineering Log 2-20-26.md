This morning, we finished up the base PCB design. I modified the footprint of the LGA microphone to have the correct pinout, but I may need to modify the sizes of each pad if they don't match.
A connector for the LED was added so we can easily mount it to the chassis, as we did with the switch yesterday night.
PCB subsystems were also organized, and the microphone/speaker are on opposite sides of the op-amp to improve signal isolation.

We went to the PCB review and quickly received approval, only needing to add two test points on the power rails to ensure they're working.

The team contract was slightly modified to add one more bullet point for expectations, and submitted.
