Started on the project proposal today. I expected the template to have only the parts we needed, but it looks like it's a template for the final project. Weeded out the parts we don't need.
Worked on revamping the introduction because the wording wasn't up to my arbitrary specifications. We have the TA meeting tomorrow with Gayatri, unsure of what we'll need to have finished but the intro section is complete.
Going to try and get Bill to work on the block diagram, and Kyle on the subsystem requirements and descriptions. Hasn't been a lot of work since the RFA, we don't have a ton to do here yet.

I should be starting on the PCB design rather shortly, as the review is coming up soon (???). Don't understand why the breadboard demo is AFTER we've submitted our first board. Confusing, but whatever.
Should get some good feedback tomorrow upon meeting with Gayatri, hopefully chosen because they have familiarity with our subject area (analog circuitry + signal processing).
Meeting with Gregg should be decided on soon as well, they can make us a free and custom chassis for the device, we'll see what's needed, especially after talking to TA.
