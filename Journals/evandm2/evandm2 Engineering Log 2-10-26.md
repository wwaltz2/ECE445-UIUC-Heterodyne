Had our meeting today, but unfortunately, Bill and Kyle didn't have much set up for the block diagram and subsystems, respectively.

Gayatri plans to run our design by Arne, who approved our RFA, to get a deeper look into how the project needs to be modified for approval. I'm not sure what else needs modifying from what we have now, but more work into the design needs to happen soon.
Didn't seem happy about the lack of delegation that's been going on; I can mostly be blamed for that. The arbitrary separation of "I'll do hardware, you guys do the MCU/programming" isn't too likely to work out great.
Plus, that puts a lot on me for the number of modules I have to put together, and removes any aspect of working together on the PCB design, which is where the hardware stuff will really coalesce.

Wanted us to put a bill of materials together ASAP. That's been done, many items on there are TBD, as we don't know a lot of them without designing the board. Just gives an overview of what we'll need.
Got our locker and CFOP number for ordering stuff. Discussed the viability of using the machine shop, but 3D printing our chassis seems to be the best option as long as we do it early.

### PCB info

We've decided on most of the major components of our design, some being directly lifted from the Magenta Bat4 that Dr. O'Keefe graciously gifted us for R&D purposes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
